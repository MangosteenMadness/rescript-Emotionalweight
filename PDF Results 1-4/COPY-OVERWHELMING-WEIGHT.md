What Your Score Means

**Body Text:**
You're carrying an overwhelming emotional burden that's significantly impacting multiple areas of your life. The weight of unprocessed experiences is creating chronic stress that affects your physical health, relationships, work, and daily functioning.

Please hear this: **What you're experiencing is valid. You are not defective, weak, or broken. You've been dealing with more than most people can imagine, and you've survived. That alone is remarkable.**

The fact that you're here, reading this, means some part of you still believes healing is possible. That part of you is right. This weight is not permanent. It feels permanent, but it isn't.

**You don't have to carry this alone anymore.**

---

## PAGE 3: UNDERSTANDING YOUR RESULT

**Header:**
The Weight You're Carrying Is Real

**Body Text:**
A score this high means you're not dealing with ordinary stress. You're dealing with chronic, unprocessed trauma that has compounded over time. Your nervous system is exhausted. Your body is exhausted. And you're probably exhausted from pretending you're okay.

**Section: Your Current State** (Light gray box)
You likely experience chronic anxiety, depression, or both. Sleep is deeply disrupted. Physical symptoms are significant — chronic pain, illness, or complete exhaustion. Relationships feel impossible because trusting people feels dangerous. You might dissociate, self-harm, or rely on substances to cope. Daily functioning takes everything you have.

You're not imagining this. You're not being dramatic. This is what happens when a person carries more than they were meant to carry.

**Section: What's Creating This Weight**
Overwhelming emotional burden typically comes from:
- Severe trauma (abuse, violence, loss, medical trauma)
- Complex PTSD (multiple traumas over time)
- Developmental trauma (unsafe childhood)
- Lack of any safe relationships to process with
- Systemic oppression or ongoing threat
- Traumatic experiences that were minimized or denied
- Having to survive when you needed to heal

**Section: What You Might Experience** (Light gray box)
- Chronic anxiety, depression, or suicidal thoughts
- Severe sleep disruption and significant physical illness
- Relationship breakdowns or complete isolation
- Inability to regulate emotions without extreme measures
- Heavy reliance on avoidance, numbing, or dissociation
- Feeling disconnected from your body or reality
- Believing you're fundamentally unworthy of love or healing
- Constant hypervigilance or complete shutdown

**Callout Box (Orange border, bold text):**
**If you're having thoughts of suicide or self-harm, please call 988 (Suicide Prevention Lifeline) or text HOME to 741741 right now. What you're feeling is temporary, even if it doesn't feel that way.**

## PAGE 4: THE SCIENCE — YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS STUCK

**Header:**
This Is Not Your Fault

**Body Text:**
Dr. James Pennebaker spent four decades studying trauma and healing. His research revealed something critical: **the symptoms you're experiencing are not character flaws. They're your nervous system's response to chronic threat.**

**Section: What's Happening in Your Brain**
When trauma isn't processed, your amygdala (alarm system) never turns off. It continues flooding your system with stress hormones, keeping you in constant survival mode. Your prefrontal cortex (reasoning center) is overwhelmed and offline much of the time.

This is why you might:
- React to small things with intense emotion
- Feel numb when you "should" feel something
- Make decisions that don't serve you
- Struggle with memory and concentration
- Feel like you're watching your life from outside

**Your brain is trying to protect you, but it's using outdated information about danger.**

**Callout Box (Light blue background):**
**The Trauma Cycle:**
Original trauma → No safe space to process → Nervous system stays activated → Symptoms develop → Shame about symptoms → More stress → Harder to heal → Cycle continues

**But this cycle can be interrupted.**

**Section: Why Traditional "Just Try Harder" Doesn't Work**
You can't think your way out of trauma. You can't "choose to be positive." Your nervous system needs to be shown that the threat is over through body-based processing. That's what expressive writing does — it engages the body, emotions, and reasoning mind together.

**Research Shows:**
- Expressive writing reduces PTSD symptoms significantly
- Decreases cortisol (stress hormone) by 23%
- Improves immune function within 2 weeks
- Reduces physical pain and inflammation
- Improves sleep architecture

**Writing moves trauma from the reactive part of your brain to the processing part.** This is how memories become just memories instead of ongoing experiences.

## PAGE 5: YOU NEED MORE THAN THIS GUIDE

**Header:**
Please Hear This With Compassion

**Body Text:**
This guide can help. The prompts and protocol can create meaningful change. But if your score is this high, **you also need human support from trained professionals.**

This isn't a failure on your part. It's not weakness. It's wisdom.

**Section: Why Professional Help Matters**
Some wounds are too deep to heal alone. Some nervous systems are too dysregulated to self-regulate. Some trauma is too complex for self-help. **And that's okay.**

Therapists trained in trauma (EMDR, Somatic Experiencing, IFS, CPT) have tools that go beyond what any app or guide can provide. They can help you:
- Process experiences safely without retraumatization
- Regulate your nervous system when it's dysregulated
- Challenge beliefs that keep you stuck
- Build relationship skills in real-time
- Provide accountability and consistency

**Section: How to Find Support**
✓ Look for trauma-informed therapists on Psychology Today
✓ Specify: EMDR, Somatic Experiencing, or IFS training
✓ Ask about sliding scale if cost is a barrier
✓ Try community mental health centers
✓ Consider online therapy if in-person isn't accessible
✓ Look into trauma support groups (NAMI, local groups)

**Callout Box (Blue background, white text):**
"The strongest thing you can do is ask for help. Surviving alone made you strong. But you don't have to do it alone anymore."

**Immediate Crisis Resources Box (Red border):**
**If you need help right now:**
• National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: **988**
• Crisis Text Line: Text **HOME** to **741741**
• SAMHSA Helpline (substance/mental health): **1-800-662-4357**
• RAINN (sexual assault): **1-800-656-4673**
• National Domestic Violence Hotline: **1-800-799-7233**

**These are not signs of failure. They are signs of courage.**

## PAGE 6-7: YOUR 5 HEALING PROMPTS

**Header:**
Prompts for Beginning the Work (With Support)

**Subheader:**
These prompts are starting points, not complete solutions. Ideally, work through these with a therapist or trusted support person. If you do them alone, have crisis resources ready and give yourself permission to stop if it becomes too much.

**Important:** Healing is not linear. You don't have to do all of these. You don't have to do them perfectly. You just have to start.

---

**Prompt 1 Box (Light gray background, rounded corners):**
**1. What does this pain feel like in my body, and where is it stored?**

Trauma lives in the body. Where do you feel it? Your chest, throat, stomach, shoulders?

Write about: The physical sensation of your pain. Give it a color, temperature, texture. Don't try to make it make sense. Just describe the sensation. This begins the process of reconnecting with your body.

*Note: If this brings up overwhelming physical sensations, stop and try grounding (5 things you see, 4 you hear, 3 you touch, 2 you smell, 1 you taste).*

---

**Prompt 2 Box:**
**2. What story am I telling myself about why I deserve this burden?**

Often, we carry shame alongside pain. We tell ourselves it's our fault, we deserved it, or we're uniquely unlovable.

Write about: The narrative you've internalized. What do you believe about yourself because of what happened? Write it down, no matter how painful. Then ask: "Is this objectively true, or is this what trauma taught me?"

*This prompt challenges core beliefs. It might be the hardest one.*

---

**Prompt 3 Box:**
**3. What would it feel like to be unburdened, even for one day?**

You might not be able to imagine full healing yet. That's okay. What would one day of relief feel like?

Write about: One day where you wake up and the weight is gone. What would you do? How would you move through the world? What small joy would you notice? Let yourself imagine this, even if you don't believe it's possible.

---

**Prompt 4 Box:**
**4. Who or what am I holding onto that I need to release?**

Sometimes we hold onto pain because letting go feels like betrayal, or because the pain is the last connection we have to someone or something.

Write about: What you're gripping. Is it a person, a belief, an identity, a sense of loyalty? What would happen if you loosened your grip? What are you afraid you'd lose?

---

**Prompt 5 Box:**
**5. What support do I need to ask for that I've been avoiding?**

You've been doing this alone. What help have you needed but been too afraid, ashamed, or exhausted to ask for?

Write about: What you actually need (not what you think you should need). Money? Housing? Therapy? Someone to watch your kids while you rest? Medical care? It's okay to need things. Write down what you need, even if you don't know how you'll get it yet.

## PAGE 8: THE 4-DAY RESCRIPT PROTOCOL

**Header:**
A Tool to Begin (But Not a Complete Solution)

**Subheader:**
The 4-day protocol can provide significant relief, especially when paired with professional support. Many people with complex trauma find that doing this protocol *with* a therapist is most effective.

**Before You Begin:**
✓ Tell someone you trust that you're doing this
✓ Have crisis resources saved in your phone
✓ Set up supports (comfort items, grounding tools)
✓ Give yourself permission to stop if it's too much
✓ Consider working with a therapist through the process

---

**Day 1 Box (Light purple background):**
**📝 Day 1: Expressive Writing**
Choose one experience to focus on (not everything at once). Write for 20 minutes. Be as raw as you need to be. If you dissociate, stop and ground yourself first. 

*You don't have to start with the worst thing. Start with something painful but manageable.*

---

**Day 2 Box (Light blue background):**
**🔄 Day 2: Perspective Shift**
Read what you wrote yesterday (if you can). Then write about the same experience from the perspective of someone who loves you. What would they say happened? What would they want you to know?

*This is about adding complexity, not minimizing your experience.*

---

**Day 3 Box (Light teal background):**
**💡 Day 3: Meaning Making**
This day is optional if it feels too hard. If you do it: What did surviving this cost you? What did it teach you about the world? About people? About yourself? Is there any strength you developed that you didn't have before?

*There's no pressure to find silver linings. Sometimes the only meaning is "I endured."*

---

**Day 4 Box (Light green background):**
**🌅 Day 4: Integration**
Write a letter from your future self — the version of you that has found a way to live with this without it consuming you. What does that person want you to know? What advice do they have?

*You're not imagining being "cured." You're imagining being able to carry it differently.*

---

**What to Expect Box (Gradient background, white text):**
**This might be really hard.**
You might feel worse before feeling better. You might cry, rage, or shut down. You might need to take breaks. All of this is normal with trauma this complex.

**If at any point you feel unsafe, stop and reach out for support.**

The protocol works, but it works best when you're not doing it completely alone.

## PAGE 9: YOUR PATH FORWARD

**Header:**
Building a Life That Supports Healing

**Subheader:**
Recovery from this level of trauma is not linear. It's not quick. And it's not something you can do by sheer willpower. You need resources, support, and time.

---

**Section 1: Immediate Actions**
✓ Find a trauma-informed therapist (this is priority #1)
✓ Join a support group if accessible
✓ Tell at least one person you trust what you're dealing with
✓ Start the 4-day protocol when you have support in place
✓ Use Rescript Journal alongside professional help

**Section 2: Address Basic Needs**
✓ Sleep (even if it's terrible, try to protect it)
✓ Eat something, even if you don't want to
✓ Move your body, even just standing up sometimes
✓ Reduce substances that numb (they delay healing)
✓ Get medical care for physical symptoms

**Section 3: Build Safety First**
✓ If you're in an unsafe environment, prioritize escape
✓ Reduce contact with people who retraumatize you
✓ Create physical spaces that feel safe
✓ Establish routines (your nervous system needs predictability)
✓ Learn grounding techniques for flashbacks

**Section 4: Long-Term Healing**
✓ Understand that healing is not linear
✓ Track progress in small increments (bad days will happen)
✓ Build relationships slowly (trust takes time to rebuild)
✓ Find meaning and purpose (but don't rush this)
✓ Celebrate tiny wins (you got out of bed? That counts.)
