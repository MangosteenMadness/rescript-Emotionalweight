What Your Score Means

**Body Text:**
You're carrying a moderate emotional burden that's starting to affect your daily life. You likely have some unprocessed experiences creating background stress that you've learned to live with, but it takes effort to maintain.

You're functional and capable, but you might feel like you're working harder than you should to keep things together. There's weight on your shoulders that you've gotten used to carrying.

The good news: You're at the perfect stage for healing. You have enough awareness to recognize something's off, but you're not overwhelmed. This is actually the ideal time to do the work.

## PAGE 3: UNDERSTANDING YOUR RESULT

**Header:**
What Moderate Emotional Weight Feels Like

**Body Text:**
Your score puts you in a zone that many people recognize but few talk about. You're not "fine," but you're also not in crisis. You're somewhere in between — managing, but at a cost.

**Section: Your Current State** (Light gray box)
You likely have days where everything feels heavy, even without obvious cause. You might ruminate more than you'd like, replay conversations, or find yourself stuck in negative thought patterns. Sleep might be affected, or you might feel physically tense without knowing why.

**Section: What's Creating This Weight**
Moderate emotional burden typically comes from:
- Unresolved experiences from your past (childhood, relationships, losses)
- Accumulated stress that never fully gets processed
- Patterns you've noticed but haven't addressed
- Things you "should be over" but aren't
- Emotions you've learned to suppress rather than feel

**Section: What You Might Experience** (Light gray box)
- Regular stress or anxiety that lingers longer than it should
- Occasional sleep disruption or unexplained fatigue
- Relationship friction or difficulty being vulnerable
- Recurring negative thought patterns or self-criticism
- Periods of emotional numbness alternating with overwhelm
- Physical tension (tight shoulders, clenched jaw, headaches)

**Callout Box (Orange border):**
"You've been carrying this long enough that it feels normal. But 'normal' doesn't mean healthy."

## PAGE 6-7: YOUR 5 HEALING PROMPTS

**Header:**
Prompts for Processing Your Emotional Weight

**Subheader:**
These prompts are designed to help you identify and process what you're carrying. Set aside 20 minutes in a private space where you won't be interrupted.

---

**Prompt 1 Box (Light gray background, rounded corners):**
**1. What past experience keeps replaying in my mind, and why?**

If something keeps coming back, your mind is trying to tell you it's unfinished. What memory, conversation, or experience do you replay?

Write about: The experience in detail, what bothers you most about it, what you wish had been different, and what your mind might be trying to process. Don't censor yourself.

---

**Prompt 2 Box:**
**2. If my stress had a voice, what would it be trying to tell me?**

Stress isn't random — it's often a messenger. What is the underlying message beneath your anxiety or overwhelm?

Write about: What you're really worried about (not the surface concern, but the deeper fear), what need isn't being met, and what you might be avoiding by staying stressed.

---

**Prompt 3 Box:**
**3. What pattern in my relationships might be connected to my past?**

We often recreate familiar dynamics without realizing it. Do you notice any recurring patterns in how relationships unfold?

Write about: A pattern you've noticed (picking unavailable people, difficulty with conflict, fear of abandonment, etc.), where this pattern might have originated, and how it's serving or harming you now.

---

**Prompt 4 Box:**
**4. What emotion am I avoiding, and what would happen if I let myself feel it?**

Sometimes the weight we carry is the energy it takes to NOT feel something. What emotion have you been keeping at arm's length?

Write about: The emotion you avoid (anger, grief, shame, fear), why you're afraid to feel it, what you think would happen if you did, and whether that fear is realistic.

---

**Prompt 5 Box:**
**5. What would my life look like if I released this weight?**

Imagine waking up without this burden. What would be different about your days, relationships, energy, and choices?

Write about: Specific changes you'd notice, what you'd do differently, who you'd be without this weight, and what's keeping you from moving toward that version of yourself.

## PAGE 8: THE 4-DAY RESCRIPT PROTOCOL

**Header:**
Your Path to Releasing the Weight

**Subheader:**
The Rescript Protocol was designed specifically for people at your level — enough weight to matter, but not so much that you're overwhelmed.

---

**Day 1 Box (Light purple background):**
**📝 Day 1: Expressive Writing**
Choose one thing from your prompts that felt the most charged. Write about it for 15-20 minutes without stopping. Don't worry about grammar, structure, or making sense. This is for your eyes only. Let it be messy.

*What happens: You externalize the internal. Getting it out of your head and onto paper reduces the mental load you've been carrying.*

---

**Day 2 Box (Light blue background):**
**🔄 Day 2: Perspective Shift**
Read what you wrote yesterday, then rewrite the same experience from a different perspective. What would your future self say? What would a compassionate friend say? What truth are you not seeing?

*What happens: You create distance from the emotion and engage your reasoning mind, which allows for new insights.*

---

**Day 3 Box (Light teal background):**
**💡 Day 3: Meaning Making**
What did this experience teach you? How has it shaped who you are today? What strength did you develop because of it? If you had to find one piece of wisdom in it, what would it be?

*What happens: You transform pain into growth. This doesn't mean it was "worth it" — it means you don't let it be meaningless.*

---

**Day 4 Box (Light green background):**
**🌅 Day 4: Integration**
Write a letter from your future self (one year from now) who has processed this weight. What does life look like? How do you feel? What advice does that version of you have for today's you?

*What happens: You create a roadmap forward and signal to your brain that change is possible.*

---

**Results Box (Gradient background, white text):**
**What to Expect:**
Most people report feeling noticeably lighter after Day 2, with significant shifts by Day 4. You might cry, feel angry, or experience relief. All of this is normal and healthy.
